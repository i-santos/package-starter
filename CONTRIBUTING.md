# Contributing

## Workflow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Make focused commits using conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
3. Run `npm install` and `npm run check` before opening a PR.
4. Add a changeset for publishable changes:
   - `npm run changeset`
5. Open a pull request and wait for CI.

## Pull Request Rules

- Keep PRs small and scoped.
- Update docs when behavior changes.
- Do not include unrelated refactors.

## Release Policy

- Official npm releases are generated by CI using Changesets after merge to `main`.
- CI publish uses npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) via `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
