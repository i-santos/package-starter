Add orchestrated `init` mode with optional integrated GitHub and npm setup (`--with-github`, `--with-beta`, `--with-npm`) including preflight validation, interactive confirmations, and step-by-step progress reporting.

Also switch branch rulesets to require a stable CI context (`CI / required-check (pull_request)`) and update the CI template to expose a stable `required-check` job.
