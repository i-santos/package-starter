Add beta release setup and stable promotion commands.

- Add `setup-beta` to configure beta scripts and `release-beta.yml` workflow.
- Add `promote-stable` to exit prerelease mode and generate explicit stable-promotion changeset.
- Expand templates/init/create defaults with beta scripts and beta workflow scaffolding.
- Update docs and tests for beta branch release flow (`release/beta` -> `main`).
